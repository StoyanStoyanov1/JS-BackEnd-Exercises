            <h1>Discover the Beauty of the Volcanoes</h1>
            <p>A volcano is an opening in the earth's surface that allows magma, volcanic ash and gases to escape. They
                are generally found where tectonic plates come together or separate, but they can also occur in the
                middle of plates due to volcanic hotspots.</p>
